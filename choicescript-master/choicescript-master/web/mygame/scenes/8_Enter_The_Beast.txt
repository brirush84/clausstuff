As you walk down the hallway with Mrs. Claus, the doors close behind you with a solid thunk. 
You can't suppress a shiver. Mrs. Claus squeezes your hand. “Be firm. It will be all right.”

You are shown into a penthouse office, with wrap-around windows letting in the twilight. Mr. Liontari stands behind a broad desk.

“Please, be seated,” he says, indicating a pair of armchairs near an endtable with two cups of tea.

Mrs. Claus sits down. She pulls off her gloves and folds them before grabbing a cup.
