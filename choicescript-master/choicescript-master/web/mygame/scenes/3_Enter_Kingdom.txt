The crowd breaks into applause, and Fractured Quartz slips behind the curtain. The meeting breaks up, and everyone wanders to the next room for refreshments.

Candid Mistletoe whispers, “I have to go. I'll explain later.” She runs off, and you're left to your own devices. 

You look over the crowd. It's time to get more information, but who do you talk to?

*fake_choice
	#A group of faeries dressed in spider silk, sipping dew from acorn cups.
		*if Elegant >=50 
			The faeries tolerate your presence. Though they don't speak to you directly, their conversation reveals a great deal about the Nightmare King and Fractured Quartz. 
			*set Kingdom_Progress +1
			*set Connections %+10
		*if (Elegant < 50) and (Elegant >=30)
			The faeries let you eat with them, but are sullen and silent. They only begin talking again as you leave, but you hear something of interest just as you go.
			*set Kingdom_Progress +1
		*if Elegant <30
			The faeries are directly offended, splashing your face with their drinks. You don't learn more about the Kingdom, but some nearby trolls are impressed, leading to a small scene.
	#A rowdy bunch of trolls fighting over a mountain of spiced ham.
		*if Gluttonous >=40
			After stuffing yourself, you discover you've won an eating contest. You learn quite a bit from the trolls, and make some friends to boot. 
			*set Kingdom_Progress +1
			*set Connections %+10
		*if (Gluttonous <40) and (Gluttonous >=30)
			You manage to snatch some ham, but you get lost in the shuffle. As everyone recovers from their feast, you overhear some unexpected information.
			*set Kingdom_Progress +1
		*if Gluttonous <30
			You get thrown far from the group, and miss out on any opportunities to gather information.
	#A sour-faced old spirit glowering at every happy couple that passes by. 
		*if Grumpy_Goose >=50
			The spirit takes to you instantly, complaining about modern trends and revealing that their significant other disappeared after being invited to a ceremony involving the Nightmare King. 
			*set Kingdom_Progress +1
			*set Connections %+10			
		*if (Grumpy_Goose <50) and (Grumpy_Goose >=30) 
			The spirit is standoffish, but complains enough about the way Fractured Quartz runs things for you to gather a substantial amount of information. (+KoD progress)
			*set Kingdom_Progress +1
		*if Grumpy_Goose <30
			The spirit is offended, and abandons you.
