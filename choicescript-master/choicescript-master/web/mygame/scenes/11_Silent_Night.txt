Messengers begin flying in from every corner of the unseen world: hags on splintered broomsticks, pixies with feet dipped in blood, and rolling rock trolls with missing limbs. All of them have the same report: Flickering Flame is on the move, with an army of thousands.

As the messengers find out one by one that Mrs. Claus is gone, they fall to pieces. Some sit weeping on the ground, and others pound their fists in anger.

A wispy ghost-boy wearing a nightgown and holding a candle floats up to you. Candid Mistletoe, as the Ghost of Christmas Past -- how appropriate.

“We have to do something,” he says. “We need to mount a defense against Flickering Flame.”

	#“The elves trust me. If we work together, we can rally the Fae and take back the Unseen World.” (tests Elf Rank)

	#“Candid, no one has the Elves' respect like you, now that Mrs. Claus is gone. You need to take charge, and I'll be right there at your side.” (tests Candid Mistletoe)

	#I start singing an old Christmas carol, trying to kindle the Christmas spirit left in their hearts. (tests Christmas spirit)

	#“After they hear what I have to tell them, no one will fear Flickering Flame again. I hope.” (tests Army of Flames progress)

Successes are declined, with the amount of success corresponding to your army's size, which is correlated to the amount of damage the world sustains. It also is a contributing factor to your relative positions of authority when dealing with Flickering Flame and Glass Ghost later on (as prisoners of war, or as your captors, or as equals).
