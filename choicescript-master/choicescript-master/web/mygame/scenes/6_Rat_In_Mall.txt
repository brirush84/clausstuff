You skate along the slippery floor on the upper level of the the mall, keeping pace with Glass Ghost down below. They hop from kiosk to kiosk. A small blur of motion is all you can see, and you know the humans can't see a thing.

Your heart is jingling in your chest as you push yourself to follow. Suddenly, you realize exactly where they're headed: Stefani's Jewelers. Gemstones have a strong connection to both worlds, and the mingled greed, love, and hope of humans pulls them even closer. There must be a rip in the worlds back there.

You hear a crash and it tears your attention back to the chase. Glass Ghost has just been side-swiped by a rogue toddler on a motorized scooter shaped like a zebra!

You make it to Stefani's with just seconds to come up with a plan.
