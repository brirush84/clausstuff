Copper Crank continues to examine the toy, turning it and examining it. This is taking her quite a bit longer than you thought it would.

The mounds of junk behind the tinker shift. She pays no notice.

The mounds shift again, and two figures emerge, shaking off old tin cans and busted TV monitors. They shuffle towards you, and you see that they are child-sized crab-like robots.

“Excuse me,” you say.

She ignores you.

“Excuse me!”

She answers without looking. “Those are old creations. Rough drafts for mechanical soldiers. Pay them no mind. They should be no problem for an honored servant of Mrs. Claus.” She chuckles.

The creatures have been steadily advancing. Now they split up, trying to surround you.
