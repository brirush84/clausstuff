#Egypt

Mrs. Claus taught you how to avoid .... She could be here, but...
	

	
Your bones are aching. It's been centuries since you've been in the field, and you're not sure you're up to any more of this tonight. 

You hear a low growl as you enter the living room. You spy a thick-jowled, heavyset dog in the corner, tied to the recliner. She's on a long leash. And she looks mad.

*fake_choice
	#What a cute little girl! I conjure up a gingerbread dog treat for her.

	#What's that lump in my coat? Scrap metal and batteries? A robot spider might keep the beast away.

		*set Tinkering %+10

	#In my youth, I ran in the great hunt with Odin and his pack. I slip into my old wolf form long enough to cross to the stairs.

You smile. 
		
There's just one problem: where is the tree? You were expecting it to be here. Kolya must have hidden it.
