You feel a rush of thoughts and feelings flood into you.

Fear. An image of Mrs. Claus. Anger. Candid Mistletoe. The earth, from space. Confusion.

It's suffocating.

		*if Carl_Alan >= 65
			Carl Alan enters the King with you, and acts as interpreter (but seems possessed, like the Exorcist, keeping with the faux-horror-movie theme). It pulls the worlds together more.
