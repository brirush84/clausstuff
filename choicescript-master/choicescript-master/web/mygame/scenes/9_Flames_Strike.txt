Panic erupts as Mrs. Claus springs her trap. An ogre smashes into you and sends you flying.

You crash into a table and roll off to the ground, tangled in a tablecloth. Strong hands grab your shoulders and pull you out; you find yourself face to face with a gargoyle. You recognize her; she's part of Flickering Flame's crew.

She hisses at you and digs her claws into your back.
